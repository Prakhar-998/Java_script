js(default)= sunchronous, single threaded ie one operation at a time after one another
each operation for the last one to cpmplete before starting to execute

blocking code(sync )vs non blocking code(async)
stops the flow of program to run the next operation vs doesnt stop the flow and let u run next onw while previous one runs in background
use cases differ, non blocking is useful as long as registeration or payment gateways are not concerned
